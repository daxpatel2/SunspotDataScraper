Error calculations:
Observer Bias (reporting different amounts and types of spots based on different observer)
Rounding errors (up, down etc..)
Instrumentation Error (what is the accuracy and error rate from the instruments that report the sunspot data)
Reporting Error (what is the error rate of the reports, manual and automatic)
Code Errors (any errors that we are not accounting (rounding of sunspots more than 3 months into the new year)
Round off errors (cutting of certain years or thresholds during graphing)
